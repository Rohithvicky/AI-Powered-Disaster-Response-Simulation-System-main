# Sound Fix Summary

## ðŸŽµ **Problem Fixed: Multiple Sounds Playing**

### **Issue**
- When a victim was rescued, multiple sound effects were playing
- This happened because the same rescue operation was being processed multiple times

### **Solution Implemented**

1. **Added Rescue Tracking System**
   - Created `processedRescues` Set to track which rescues have already been processed
   - Each rescue gets a unique ID: `${step}-${victimX}-${victimY}`

2. **Sound Playback Control**
   - Sounds only play once per rescue operation
   - Success sound only plays for non-rescue_team resources
   - Proper timing between resource sounds (200ms delay)

3. **Reset Functionality**
   - When simulation is reset, processed rescues are cleared
   - This allows sounds to play again for new rescues

### **How It Works Now**

1. **Rescue Happens**: Victim is saved by rescuer
2. **Unique ID Created**: Based on step number and victim position
3. **Check if New**: Only process if this rescue hasn't been seen before
4. **Play Sounds**: Each resource type gets its unique sound
5. **Show Notification**: Success message appears once
6. **Mark as Processed**: Add to processed rescues set

### **Sound Sequence**
- **Resource Sound**: Unique sound for each resource type (ambulance, fire truck, etc.)
- **Success Sound**: Musical chord plays after resource sound (300ms delay)
- **No Duplicates**: Each rescue only triggers sounds once

### **Testing**
1. Start simulation
2. Watch rescuer move to victim
3. When rescue happens, you should hear:
   - One sound per resource type used
   - One success sound
   - No duplicate sounds

The fix ensures a clean, professional audio experience! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ”Š
